# NoMonth

DRAFT of the `#NoMonth` manifesto.

---

Months are crap. They are a bad unit of time, as they have a very variable length (30, 31, 28, 29?). They don't align to the astronomical phenomenon they are supossed to (lunar phases [and thus, the tides?]).

# Alternatives

## Addressing Weeks

Weeks are much more relevant units of time as they have a fixed (7 days) length and are our usual work-leisure cycle.

On ISO 8601 formats: `YYYY-Www` for weeks, and `YYYY-Www-D` for days.

## Addressing days

### Ordinal date

Consistis of a year and a day of the year.

On ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-DDD`.
